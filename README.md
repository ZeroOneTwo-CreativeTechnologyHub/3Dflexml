# 3DFlexML: Adaptive, Intelligent, and Open

![3DFlexML Logo](https://your-image-url.com) *(Replace with actual image link)*

**3DFlexML** is an open-source platform that integrates **3D-printed flexible conductive sensors** with **TinyML** to create adaptable, real-time sensing solutions. It enables users to print sensors in any form and train embedded machine learning models to interpret touch, bend, and pressure inputs, making it ideal for applications in **wearables, robotics, human-computer interaction, and industrial automation**.
