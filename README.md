# 3DFlexML: Adaptive, Intelligent, and Open

![3DFlexML Logo](https://your-image-url.com) *(Replace with actual image link)*

**3DFlexML** is an open-source platform that integrates **3D-printed flexible conductive sensors** with **TinyML** to create adaptable, real-time sensing solutions. It enables users to print sensors in any form and train embedded machine learning models to interpret touch, bend, and pressure inputs, making it ideal for applications in **wearables, robotics, human-computer interaction, and industrial automation**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Customisable 3D-printed sensors** – Print flexible conductive sensors tailored to your specific needs.
- **Embedded TinyML intelligence** – Process sensor data in real-time with low-power, on-device machine learning.
- **Versatile applications** – Suitable for wearables, smart textiles, robotics, and interactive surfaces.
- **Open-source & extensible** – Modify, expand, and contribute to the development of 3DFlexML.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** – Works with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico, and ESP32.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
- A 3D printer with **conductive TPU filament**
- A compatible microcontroller (e.g., **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**, **ESP32**, **Raspberry Pi Pico**)
- TinyML framework (e.g., **TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers**, **Edge Impulse**)
- Python 3+ and necessary dependencies

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3DFlexML.git
cd 3DFlexML

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Printing & Building the Sensor
1. **3D print your sensor** using the provided STL files in the `/hardware` folder.
2. **Assemble and connect** the sensor to your chosen microcontroller.
3. **Upload the TinyML model** to your board using the provided scripts.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Print a sensor** – Design and print a flexible conductive sensor using TPU filament.
2. **Train a model** – Use TinyML to recognise patterns from sensor inputs (e.g., bending, pressure, motion).
3. **Deploy to hardware** – Run the trained model on a microcontroller for real-time analysis.
4. **Customise & expand** – Adapt the sensor’s form factor and AI model for different use cases.

## 🎯 Applications
- **Wearables** – Smart insoles, fitness trackers, posture correction devices.
- **Soft Robotics** – Flexible robotic touch sensors, pressure-sensitive grippers.
- **Human-Computer Interaction** – Touch-sensitive controllers, adaptive keyboards.
- **Industrial Monitoring** – Structural health monitoring, custom input devices.
