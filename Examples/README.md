# 3DFlexML Examples

This folder contains example projects demonstrating how to use **3DFlexML** for various applications. Each example includes instructions, code, and STL files for 3D-printed sensors.

## 📌 Available Examples

### 1️⃣ Bend Detection Sensor - TBC
**Description:** A simple example using a 3D-printed flexible conductive sensor to detect bending and classify different gestures with TinyML.
<!--
- **Hardware:** Conductive TPU sensor, ESP32/Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
- **Software:** TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
- **Steps:**
  1. Print the bend sensor (STL file included in `/hardware`).
  2. Train a TinyML model using Edge Impulse or TensorFlow.
  3. Deploy the model and detect different bending gestures.

➡️ See `/examples/bend-detection/README.md` for full details.

### 2️⃣ Pressure-Sensitive Insole- TBC
**Description:** A custom insole with embedded conductive TPU sensors to detect foot pressure and gait patterns.
<!--
- **Hardware:** Flexible TPU-based pressure sensors
- **Software:** TensorFlow Lite, Arduino

➡️ More details coming soon!
