# 3DFlexML: Adaptive, Intelligent, and Open

![3DFlexML Logo](https://your-image-url.com) *(Replace with actual image link)*

**3DFlexML** is an open-source platform that integrates **3D-printed flexible conductive sensors** with **TinyML** to create adaptable, real-time sensing solutions. It enables users to print sensors in any form and train embedded machine learning models to interpret touch, bend, and pressure inputs, making it ideal for applications in **wearables, robotics, human-computer interaction, and industrial automation**.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with 3DFlexML, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZeroOneTwo-CreativeTechnologyHub/3Dflexml.git
   ```
2. **Install Required Software:**
   - Arduino IDE
   - Python 3.x (for data processing scripts)
   - 3D modeling software (e.g., Fusion 360)
3. **Refer to Sensor-Specific Setup:**
   - Each sensor has its own folder with setup and usage instructions.
   - See **[1_Example_Sensor/README.md](1_Example_Sensor/README.md)** for an example implementation.
